Heart Disease Prediction – Decision Trees & Random Forests
Overview
This project is part of my AI & ML Internship – Task 5, where I explored tree-based machine learning models using the Heart Disease Dataset.
The goal was to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes, and to compare Decision Trees with Random Forests. 

Objectives
Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it.

Understand overfitting and control tree depth.

Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare results.

Interpret feature importances.

Evaluate using cross-validation.

Dataset
File: heart.csv

Target Column: target → 1 (disease) / 0 (no disease)

Source: Heart Disease Dataset – Kaggle

Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – ML models and evaluation

Graphviz – Tree visualization

Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset.

Split the data into training & test sets.

Trained a baseline Decision Tree Classifier.

Visualized the decision tree.

Tested overfitting by controlling max_depth.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

Compared accuracies between models.

Plotted feature importance to understand which features matter most.
